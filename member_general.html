            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Section 1. Object</strong>
                    <p>
                        These conditions of sale aim to define the contractual relationship between VOLTA Mobiles and the buyer and the conditions applicable to any purchase made through the www.voltamobiles.com website. The acquisition of a product through this site implies an unreserved acceptance by the buyer of these conditions of sale which the buyer acknowledges having read prior to his order. Before any transaction, the buyer declares on the one hand that the purchase of products on the www.voltamobiles.com site is not directly related to his professional activity and is limited to strictly personal use and on the other hand to have full legal capacity, allowing him to commit himself under these general conditions of sale. The company VOLTA Mobiles retains the right to modify at any time these conditions of sale, in order to comply with any new regulations or in order to improve the use of its site. Therefore, the applicable conditions will be those in force on the date of the order by the buyer.
                    </p>

                    <strong>Article 2. Produce</strong>
                    <p>
                        The products offered are those listed on the www.voltamobiles.com website of the company VOLTA Mobiles, within the limits of available stocks. VOLTA Mobiles reserves the right to change the product assortment at any time. Each product is presented on the website in the form of a description containing its main characteristics.

                    <strong>Article 3. Rates</strong>
                    <p>
                        The prices appearing on the product sheets of the internet catalog and are prices in Euros (â‚¬) all taxes included (TTC) taking into account the VAT applicable on the day of the order.

                    <strong>Section 4. Order and terms of payment</strong>
                    <p>
                        Before any order, the buyer must create an account on the www.voltamobiles.com site. The account creation section is accessible directly from the side menu bar. At each visit, the buyer, if he wishes to order or consult his account (order status, profile ...), must identify himself using this information. VOLTA Mobiles offers the buyer to order and pay for its products in several steps, with 2 payment options to choose from:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        - Secure payment by PayPal or credit card (via the PayPal system): the buyer selects the products he wishes to order in the "basket", modifies if necessary (quantities, references ...), checks the delivery address or enters a new one. Then, the shipping costs are calculated and submitted to the buyer, as well as the name of the carrier.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Then, the buyer chooses the payment method of his choice: "Payment by PayPal". The next step offers him to check all the information, read and accept these general conditions of sale by ticking the corresponding box, then invites him to validate his order by clicking on the button "Confirm my order".
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Finally, the buyer is redirected to the secure PayPal interface in order to securely enter his PayPal account or personal credit card references. If payment is accepted, the order is registered and the contract is definitively formed. Payment by PayPal account or credit card is irrevocable. In case of fraudulent use of it, the buyer may demand the cancellation of the payment by card, the sums paid will then be recredited or returned. The responsibility of the holder of a bank card is not engaged if the disputed payment has been proven fraudulently, remotely, without physical use of his card. To obtain reimbursement of the fraudulent debit and any bank charges that the transaction may have generated, the cardholder must contest, in writing, the debit with his bank, within 70 days of the transaction, or even 120 days if the contract binding him to it so provides. The amounts debited are reimbursed by the bank within a maximum period of one month after receipt of the written objection filed by the bearer. No costs of restitution of the sums can be charged to the holder. The confirmation of an order implies acceptance of these conditions of sale, the acknowledgement of having perfect knowledge of them and the waiver of its own conditions of purchase. All the data provided and the recorded confirmation will be proof of the transaction. If the buyer has an email address and if he has entered it on his order form, VOLTA Mobiles will send him by email the confirmation of the registration of his order. If the buyer wishes to contact the company VOLTA Mobiles, he can do so either by mail to the following address: C O N T I S T U D I O & D E S I G N, S.L., Avda. del Mas Pins, 104, Nave 7, 17457, Riudellots de la Selva, Girona (SPAIN); or by email to the following address: www.voltamobiles.com">eshop@www.voltamobiles.com
